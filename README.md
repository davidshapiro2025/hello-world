# David Shapiro

Hi! I’m **David Shapiro** — founder of **The Shapiro Group**, a real estate advisory and strategy firm based in **Austin, Texas**. I help homebuyers and sellers get the best possible value in every transaction and share insights on market trends, strategic investments, and property decisions.

This repository is part of my GitHub presence where I’ll share projects, tools, and resources that support my work in real estate, homeownership education, data analysis, and market insights.
